## Intermediate 1 - Linked List Addition
__*Source*__: Cracking The Coding Interview (5th Edition)

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a
single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is
at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns
the sum as a linked list.

#### Sample Input
```
List A: 7 -> 1 -> 6
List B: 5 -> 9 -> 2

That is, 617 + 295.
```

#### Sample Output
```
2 -> 1 -> 9.
```
